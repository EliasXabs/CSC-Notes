- Assemble language
- Hardware representation

## 6 great ideas in computer architecture (Details)
### Abstraction
- Abstraction is the process of hiding the details of a system in order to simplify the system's design and implementation.
### Moore's law
- Predicts that the number of transistors on a chip will double every 2 years.
### Principle of memory hierarchy
- The principle of memory hierarchy states that the data and instructions that a computer needs to access most frequently should be stored in the fastest memory available that will also be the most expensive.
#### Storage ranking in a computer:
1. CPU
2. Cache
3. Main memory
4. Secondary memory
5. virutal memory

### Parallelism
- Parallelism is the ability of a computer to execute multiple instructions at the same time.
### Performance
- Performance is the measure of how fast a computer can execute a program.
- Performance is measured in terms of the number of instructions that can be executed per second.
### Dependability via redundancy
- Redundancy is the duplication of components in a computer system to increase the reliability of the system.
- Redundancy is achieved by using multiple copies of the same component.
## MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)
- MIPS is a measure of the performance of a computer.
> MIPS = (number of instructions) / (execution time * 10^6)\
>      = (clock rate)/(CPI * 10^6)
